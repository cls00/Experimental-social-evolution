*Implementation of artificial chemistry. Here an example of an autocatalytic reaction. More examples [here](https://github.com/cls00/Experimental-social-evolution/blob/master/Features-Preview/Artificial-Chem2.gif) and [here](https://github.com/cls00/Experimental-social-evolution/blob/master/Features-Preview/Artificial-Chem3.gif)
