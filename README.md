*Example of an evolved population of grabbers and stingers competing for food*

*Multiple arena can run at the same time with different configurations*

*Implementation of a randomised artificial chemistry. Here an example of an autocatalytic reaction. More examples [here](https://github.com/cls00/Experimental-social-evolution/blob/master/Features-Preview/Artificial-Chem2.gif) and [here](https://github.com/cls00/Experimental-social-evolution/blob/master/Features-Preview/Artificial-Chem3.gif)*

*Assets can be easily imported from the Unity store, here is an example of trees added to an arena*

![rndNet](https://github.com/cls00/Experimental-social-evolution/blob/master/Features-Preview/Random-Dynamic-Nets.gif)
*Agents can be bind with spring-like connection and form dynamic networks*

*Procedurally generated landscapes can be created for larger and more complex arenas*
